
In computer science data structure is organization of data, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. In simple words, data structure is defined as collection of data elements, relationship among them and functions and operations that can be applied to them. 

Variable: It is the name of placeholder

Data Type: It defines the behaviour and charecteristics of data which is going to be store in variable. It is of two types: user defined data type and system defined data types.

In computer terms, only two things matters: CPU Cycle and memory. Solution of any problem should be generic. There are parameters by which we decide which solution is better, these are: time and space. the time is number of CPU Cycles a solution consumed and space is memory.



There are two categories of data structure we will deal with:

- ### Linear Data Structure:

   LDS is data structure in which you access the data element in linear fashion.

   #####  Example: 

    Array, Linked List, queue, stack

   ##### Advantages:

   - easy to understand representation

   - easy to move from child to its parent

   ##### Disadvantages:

   - Length of data item should be known prior to allocation
   - requires contiguous memory allocation 
   - execution time is high

- ### Non Linear Data Structure

  NLDS is data structure in which one data element is connected with several other data element, so there is possibility that from one 
  data element we can reach one or more data element.

  ##### Example:

  Trees and Graphs

  ##### Advantages:

  - The length of the data items is not necessary to be known prior to allocation
  - memory efficient

  ##### Disadvantages:

  - overhead of link to next data items
